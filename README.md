# File ZIPper

This is the working repo for a Google Chrome extension (using chrome.fileBrowserHandler for chromeos only) that will allow a user to select files/folders from the file manager and compress them together into a ZIP file.

One goal of this project is for it to be developed entirely on Cr-48s or other Chromebooks. Between github and cloud9 this has become a difficult prospect, but I'm trying.
