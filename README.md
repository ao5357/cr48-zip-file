# File ZIPper
##About
This is the working repo for a Google Chrome extension (using chrome.fileBrowserHandler for chromeos only) that will allow a user to select files/folders from the file manager and compress them together into a ZIP file.

One goal of this project is for it to be developed entirely on Cr-48s or other Chromebooks.

The distribution version of this extension will be hosted in the Chrome Web Store, so this repo is only for development. Issues, forks, and pull requests welcome!

##[Progress Reports](https://github.com/ao5357/cr48-zip-file/wiki/Progress-Reports)
I've decided to [document the dev process](https://github.com/ao5357/cr48-zip-file/wiki/Progress-Reports) and put it in the wiki. These reports will focus on setup, workflow, and especially bugs and gotchas. Hopefully they'll be useful to someone searching google for something obscure.
